# lean_mean_app_machine
A concise, tiny starter framework for building a MEAN stack web application.

This is a starter framework, a small piece of code to jump-start application development by providing some of the groundwork for a simple web application using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) application stack. Built for my own personal use, but you're free to use it too.
